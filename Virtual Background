Introduction:
    This project implements a real-time virtual background replacement system using a green screen technique. The application captures video input from a webcam, detects the green background using color segmentation in the HSV color space, and replaces it with a user-defined image or video. The goal is to simulate a professional background environment for video calls, recordings, or presentations using simple computer vision techniques.
Features:
Real-Time Video Processing: Captures and processes live webcam footage.
Green Screen Detection: Isolates the green-colored background using HSV-based segmentation.
Background Replacement: Replaces green areas with a custom background image or video.
User Interaction: Easily exit the app with a key press (q).
Customizable: Green screen range and background can be customized for various lighting conditions.
Usages:
Virtual Meetings: Add professional or branded backgrounds in real time.
Online Education: Teachers can overlay themselves on slides or whiteboards.
Content Creation: YouTubers or streamers can use this for storytelling or reactions.
Media Production: Useful for shooting scenes requiring background changes in post.

Technologies Used:
Python – Programming language for scripting and control.
OpenCV (cv2) – Core library for real-time computer vision.
NumPy – Efficient matrix manipulation and numerical operations.
HSV Color Space – Used for accurate green detection in varying lighting conditions.
Test Description:
Start the program and ensure webcam feed loads.
Stand in front of a uniformly green background.
Observe real-time replacement of green screen with the loaded background.
Press q to exit the program.
Ensure smooth transitions, low latency, and minimal green spill on edges.
Data Description:
    1.Input Data:
Video Frames: Captured from a webcam using OpenCV (cap.read()).
Green Color Range: Defined in HSV as:
Lower Bound: [35, 40, 40]
Upper Bound: [85, 255, 255]
Background Image: Any user-provided image (background.jpg), resized to match video frame size.
2.Output Data:
Composite frame where the green area is replaced by the background image.
Displayed live in a window titled "Virtual Background".
Conclusion:
    This project demonstrates a fundamental yet effective implementation of virtual background replacement using green screen techniques in Python with OpenCV. It highlights the power of basic image processing and color segmentation in building real-time, interactive applications. While basic, this solution can serve as the foundation for more advanced systems using machine learning-based segmentation for scenarios where green screens are not available. Future improvements may include edge smoothing, adaptive masking, and real-time video background support.
